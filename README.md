# COVID sentiment analysis in Canadian social media

Project was completed in November-December 2021.

## Quick Overview

This is a data science project in which COVID sentiment in Canada was analyzed by scraping 1000 tweets in November 2021.

Data acquisition included scraping tweets using the Twitter API, manual double-annotation by category (informational, personal opinion, etc.) and sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) by three different annotators, and majority voting for annotation merging.

Data analysis included tokenization and TF-IDF analysis.

Exploratory data visualization was done to find the most efficient way to display all the findings.

All methods and results are fully discussed in the project report.


## Project purpose

The project seeks to analyze the discussion around COVID in Canadian social media.
The three main goals of the project were to:

1. Find the main topics discussed around COVID.
2. Quantify the relative engagement with those topics.
3. Quantify how positive/negative the discussion of each one those topics, as well as the general response to the pandemic has been.


## Alon's direct contribution to the project:
Equal contribution to formatting of scraped data, data cleaning and analysis, category formulation, tweet annotation, and report writing.
Exclusive contribution to data merging (from all annotators) and visualization.
